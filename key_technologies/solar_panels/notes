  Information about creation of solar panels on Luna.
  The goal is to create 12 megawatts of installed generating
  capacity using an absolute minimum of terrestrial materials,
  and terrestrial equipment.

  How little terrestrial mass can we get away with?
  How much lunar mass must be used?

  The power for the manufacture of these solar panels is to
  come initially from Earth-manufactured solar panels that are
  brought to Luna in Payload 1, and then increased using the 
  panels manufactured in this process, thus causing installed
  processing power to increase exponentially until critical 
  materials are exhausted or equipment capacity limits are 
  reached.
