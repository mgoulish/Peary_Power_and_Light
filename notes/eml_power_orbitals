EML Power Orbitals
-------------------------------------

Put large power orbitals at EML-1 and 2.

61000 km away -- worse than GEO is to Earth,
but we can focus onto large rectennas.

These are gigawatt stations, 16% efficient.

2.4 km diam circles.  1.5 mile.

They are used for ion drive propulsion and 
for beaming power to Luna.

At 20 kW per Newton ( magnetoplasmadynamic thrust )
1 GW == 50,000 N
